A user on Reddit,old_man.svg,"Was experiencing horrible headaches for two months. They were so bad I couldn't work. They were so severe and frequent that my neurologist wanted to do a brain scan. My scan was denied because I wasn't in pain for the ""minimum"" 3 months."
Joseph Gilbert,m_woman.svg,"We had insurance we could afford and still wound up with huge medical bills after a sickness and hospital stay. The following year, 2015, our monthly premium doubled. We divorced so that the kids and father could be on Medicaid. Our monthly went from $440 to almost $900. We had no choice but to legally divorce."
A user on Reddit,man.svg,"During the pandemic UnitedHealthcare called to schedule an assessment for home care for a patient who'd been previously denied and had been trying to schedule a reassessment. Great, only the patient had passed away several weeks prior. After being denied home care they were admitted to the hospital, got COVID and died"

A user on Reddit,young_man.svg,"My 52 y/o mom felt like her cancer had returned/was growing. They denied a scan my mom needed, saying she had to wait 8 more weeks because it had not been long enough since the last one. At any rate, without the scan, chemotherapy wouldn't be restarted or any sort of radiation, etc. We could not afford to pay thousands out of pocket...Things were stressful, and money was already so very tight. After some ER visits and multiple medical issues, the time finally came. The cancer had started to spread to my mom's brain, but it was now too late for anything to be done. We were told they would have needed to start treatment weeks ago to prevent it getting to that point, and there was pretty much nothing that could really be done...She was the kindest person and cared about everyone she met. UHC robbed us of more time with my mom."
A user on Youtube,old_woman.svg,"My son has been battling kidney disease since he was four years old, insurance wouldn't cover numbing medication to reduce the pain of being stuck by needles repeatably due to his veins rolling because of dehydration ( being hospitalized for 2 weeks) I can still hear him screaming for help and asking for the nurses to stop poking him. The tears I shed the income I lost you could never relate."
